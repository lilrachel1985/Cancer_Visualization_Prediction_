INTRODUCTION:
Cervical cancer is a significant public health concern worldwide, with early detection being critical for successful treatment outcomes.
In this project, I utilized deep learning techniques employing Keras with TensorFlow backend to analyze a cervical cancer dataset. The goal was to extract insights and develop a predictive model to aid in the early diagnosis of cervical cancer.

INSIGHTS:
-Does age influence the likelihood of developing cervical cancer?
-Analyzed the distribution of cervical cancer cases across different age groups.
-Determined if there's a correlation between age and the presence of cervical cancer.
-Is there a gender-based predisposition to cervical cancer?
-Investigated the proportion of cervical cancer cases among different genders.
-Explored whether gender plays a significant role in cervical cancer diagnosis.
-How does sexual activity impact cervical cancer risk?
-Examined the relationship between sexual activity and cervical cancer incidence.
-Assessed if certain sexual behaviors or practices contribute to a higher risk of cervical cancer.
-Can the number of pregnancies be a predictor of cervical cancer?
-Investigated the association between the number of pregnancies and cervical cancer diagnosis.
-Determined if multiparity is linked to an increased likelihood of cervical cancer.
-What other demographic factors are correlated with cervical cancer?
-Explored additional demographic variables such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographical location.
-Identified any demographic patterns or disparities in cervical cancer prevalence.
-How do cytology test results relate to cervical cancer prediction?
-Analyzed the distribution of cytology test outcomes (e.g., Pap smear results) among cervical cancer cases and non-cancer cases.
-Evaluated the predictive power of cytology test results in identifying cervical cancer early.
-Can a combination of demographic and clinical features improve predictive accuracy?
-Investigated the synergistic effects of multiple features (e.g., age, gender, sexual activity, cytology results) on cervical cancer prediction.
-Built predictive models incorporating various features to enhance early detection capabilities.
